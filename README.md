# Whack-A-Mole Description
It is a PCB of exactly what it sounds like.
# Whack-A-Mole Progress
- First Session: 30 minutes from the Club
    - I created a schematic with help
    - I had an idea to create a Whack-a-Mole game
    - My schematic contains:
        - 4 LEDs (light-emitting diodes)
        - 4 Buttons
        - 1 XIAO RP2040
    - I was taught how to use net labels (global labels)
    - I learned how to use and connect wires
    - I learned what a resistor and a button look like
    - My screenshot of my schematic so far:

- Second Session: 1hr at Club
    - I made my PCB
        - I moved around components (USB port, 4 LEDs, 4 buttons, and 4 resistors) to see what my PCB will look like in real life!
        - I learned how to use auto-route to make my "wires" more organized
        - Screenshot of my progress:
