# Whack-A-Mole Progress
- First Session: 30 minutes from direct teaching (I was busy)
    - I created a schematic with help
    - I had an idea to create a Whack-a-Mole game
    - My schematic contains:
        - 4 LEDs (light emitting diodes)
        - 4 Buttons
        - 1 XIAO RP2040
    - I was taught how to use net labels (global labels)
    - I learned how to use and connect wires
    - I learned what a resistor and a button look like
    - My screenshot of my schematic so far:
